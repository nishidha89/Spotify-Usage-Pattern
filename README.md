# Spotify-Usage-Pattern
Spotify, with over 574 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of Q3 2023, is undoubtedly one of the most popular music streaming apps in the world today. However, despite its huge user base, Spotify has yet to turn a profit, with a net income of around -$576 million in 2023 reportedly. Therefore, we would like to explore ways to increase Spotify's revenue.

According to reports, around 87% of Spotify's revenue is derived from its Premium subscribers. However, as of Q3 2023, Spotify had 361 million ad-supported free MAUs. Converting these users to paid plans presents a significant opportunity for the company.

# Suggestions
To attract people to switch from free to premium subscription plan we can:

Promote more relaxation playlists in Spotify advertisement;
Better promote it in evening/ night hours, while users using app more frequently. Push ad notificiations from app better send in evening hours;
I think it will be beneficial to promote some 1-3 months no-charge Premium plan subscribtions for those, who uses app for more than a year, so they can really experience the difference;
Make more advertisement of Student and Family plan subscriptions, since most of the dwellers of the local community are young women.
